## TODO

- Try using https://github.com/dpapathanasiou/simple-graph instead of dgraph!
  - I like the simple-graph philosophy but I don't like the way they built the example for go. Too much indirection and templating!
  - [ ] Identify the sql statements needed to reimplement the current dgraph stuff
  - [ ] Feed that stuff to Claude/Avante and ask it to use sqlc
